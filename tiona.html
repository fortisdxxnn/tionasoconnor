        <h3>Personality</h3>
        She has one of the most unique and beautiful personalities in the world. Always fun to be around and can cheer
        you up even on your sadest days.
        She is easy to talk to and has unique opinions on everything. Though she swears she is a badman (lol right), she
        is truly a simp at heart. She is
        clingy yet not annoying and really is a blessing from God himself.

        <h3>Intelligence</h3>
        After all this time, Ifinally got concret evidence that Tiona S O'Connor is one of the smartest persons I know.
        Seven ones innuh and 9 subjects.
        I have been telling her this for months but for some unknown reason she didn't believe me. I think finding out
        how smart someone is not that hard,
        it comes out in there perspectives and even their speech. But now that I have CXC on my side, I can truly say
        that we will definately be having smart children.

        <h3>Standards and Values</h3>
        Lol I know that this is not a conventional topic that persons talk about but it really is a unique trait when
        someone says something and sticks to it. I todays age
        a person's perspective can easily be changed based on circumstances. Tiona, I am happy to say, does not fall in
        this category as she satnds by eaach and everyone of
        her values. This may be not benefitting to me in some cases (getting head) but it truly one of the features I
        admire the most.

        <h3>Simp</h3>
        I know that I spoke to this already but this deserves a section for itself. At first she wasn't like this but
        day by day the simpyness grows a little bit more. As musch as
        I make fun of it, I appreciate how much she cares about me.Literally the firsrt person that never stops
        checkking on me and making sure I am good in all ways. I think
        at first I was afraid to ever show someone how much I love them but her simpyness cannot be topped not matter
        how much I show her love.

    <div class="tiona-details">
        <h3>Body</h3>
        Can't say this enough, LINNETTE KNEW WHAT SHE WAS DOING. Tiona was thick before she left but the definately made
        major improvements while with Linny and now she she sexy asf.
        FOr years I thought I was attracted to big girls but after seeiing Tiona naked, my wholeperspective of life
        changed. Just hope that one day she will be able to handle backaz
        one day cause its definately at the top of my bucket list.

    <div class="tiona-details">
        <h3>Beauty</h3>
        Though this is the last thing, I think it is in fact one of the most important. I know persons say that you
        should love persons for their personality and not their looks but
        you don't see somebody's personality when you just meet them. Tiona's beauty was the thing that attracted me at
        first and keeps me attracted even now 1 year later. Honestly never
        believed I would be saying this at such a young age but I really look forward to waking up next to her for the
        rest of my life.
